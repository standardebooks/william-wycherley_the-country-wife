								<span>Poets, like cudgelled bullies, never do</span>
								<br/>
								<span>At first or second blow submit to you;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But will provoke you still, and ne’er have done,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till you are weary first with laying on.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The late so baffled scribbler of this day,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Though he stands trembling, bids me boldly say,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What we before most plays are used to do,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For poets out of fear first draw on you;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In a fierce prologue the still pit defy,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, ere you speak, like Castril<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-71" id="noteref-71" epub:type="noteref">71</a> give the lie.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But though our Bayes’s battles oft I’ve fought,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And with bruised knuckles their dear conquests bought;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nay, never yet feared odds upon the stage,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In prologue dare not hector with the age;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But would take quarter from your saving hands,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Though Bayes within all yielding countermands,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Says, you confederate wits no quarter give,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Therefore his play shan’t ask your leave to live.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Well, let the vain rash fop, by huffing so,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Think to obtain the better terms of you;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But we, the actors, humbly will submit,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now, and at any time, to a full pit;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nay, often we anticipate your rage,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And murder poets for you on our stage:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We set no guards upon our tiring-room,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But when with dying colours there you come,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We patiently, you see, give up to you</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our poets, virgins, nay, our matrons too.</span>
