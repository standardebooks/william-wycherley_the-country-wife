								<span>Now you the vigorous, who daily here</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O’er vizard-mask in public domineer,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And what you’d do to her, if in place where;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nay, have the confidence to cry, “Come out!”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet when she says, “Lead on!” you are not stout;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But to your well-dressed brother straight turn round,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And cry “Pox on her, Ned, she can’t be sound!”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then slink away, a fresh one to engage,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With so much seeming heat and loving rage,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>You’d frighten listening actress on the stage;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till she at last has seen you huffing come,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And talk of keeping in the tiring-room,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet cannot be provoked to lead her home.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Next, you Falstaffs of fifty, who beset</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Your buckram maidenheads, which your friends get;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And whilst to them you of achievements boast,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They share the booty, and laugh at your cost.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In fine, you essenced boys, both old and young,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who would be thought so eager, brisk, and strong,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet do the ladies, not their husbands wrong;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose purses for your manhood make excuse,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And keep your Flanders mares for show not use;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Encouraged by our woman’s man to-day,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A Horner’s part may vainly think to play;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And may intrigues so bashfully disown,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That they may doubted be by few or none;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May kiss the cards at picquet, ombre, loo,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And so be taught to kiss the lady too;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But, gallants, have a care, faith, what you do.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world, which to no man his due will give,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>You by experience know you can deceive,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And men may still believe you vigorous,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But then we women⁠—there’s no cozening us.</span>
